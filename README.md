The steps described in this pipeline/protocol are intended to help users with analysing data generated from whole genome sequencing, from assembly, MAGs creating, phylogenetic inferring and finally to annotation. 

This pipeline was initially created by Karine Villeneuve in 2020 with the help from Valerie De Anda, Maggie Langwig and Ian Rambo during an internship with the Baker Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. The instructions from the inital pipeline were then improved with the help of Katel Hallaf in 2023 during an intership with the Lazar lab.
